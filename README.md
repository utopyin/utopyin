## Projects

### Brawlorg.com

[Brawlorg](https://brawlorg.com) is a Brawlhalla wepsite project. The goal of this website is to provide to its users statistics about players & clans, advanced guides, and a tournament creator allowing players to create their own Brawlhalla tournaments working with a Discord bot.

### Probote

Probote is a discord bot allowing its users to get access to Pronote (french official school software) on their servers. The users can link their account to discord by using the website [pronote.fr](https://pronote.fr).

## About me

I mainly do graphic design, however I love making concrete and usefull projects so programming became almost necessary. Linking these two passions allowed me to make everything myself, such as the graphics for Brawlorg for instance.
